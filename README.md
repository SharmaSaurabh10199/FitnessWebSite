# FitnessWebSite
This is my first frontend project, I have made a very basic website to apply my knowledge of html and css. 
following are the bullet points of my project: 
1) I have adjusted background image using the background property.
2) I have used html forms in this site for the enrollment.
3) i have used css flexbox to give my website proper layout.
4) Used other basic css properties such as font text, background positions etc.

I will keep working on it as i learn more skills
